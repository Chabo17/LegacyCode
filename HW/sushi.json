I have been at the top of the Mark and Sears,Joes all of them and Roys was by far the finest in the attentive staff, the drinks were good I had a mango mojito the appitizer was the sampler lobster potsticker, shortrib, aji tuna and shrimp. it was perfection nothing overpowering and my mouth was in a twirl of joy. I orderd the sea food dinner lobster, shrimp,and scallops all amazing nothing was overdone or under cooked all perfection. we shared the salid wich was baby greens and also a pleasure to enjoy. the end was a chocolate suffley that was full of chocolate syrup and it all ran out with every spoon fresh vanilla bean ice cream and coffee it was an inchanting evening and the waiter was a complete prince I felt like a Queen and ate a dream dinner."

I like the variety in the menu and the presentation of the food was a nice amenity. I was a little disappointed with the ambiance. Not a bad thing, I thought it would be a little bit more lively and crowded, but instead of it was more quiet than I thought. Which wasnt a bad thing, since my friend and I didnt have to wait for a table and could hear each other talk. Overall, I would recommend this place, but I little bit overrated, I thought reading from the other reviewers."

We ordered a starter -tuna tar tar, spicy salmon sushi, uni sushi,beef teriyaki (medium rare) w/ sashimi. The restaurant was so busy that our food came after a 20 min. wait.Whats worst is they first served a well done beef teriyaki with rice. Then after following up our other orders bec another 10 mins passed they served the sashimi and sushi. The uni sushi was great but the spicy salmon was not a bit spicy.I was disappointed. The last order that arrived was our starter-the tuna tar tar. Overall, we did not have a good experience with this restaurant with such high reviews."

      "LastReviewIntro": " great fish, watch the glass! and call ahead! (the lines are long). first a warning: you can wait up to 2hrs to get in here (my friends say in all sincerity). well I went for the 3rd time last thursday and there was no wait, but the waitress broke a glass and I found a glass chip by my sushi roll! it kinda freaked me out. so ah I am giving them 3 stars, only because I pointed out the glass chip and the waitress basically said \"so what\" ! ha. VERY nice sushi maker guy though..."
